						<li>if we are acquired by a third party, in which case the Personal Data held by us about you
							will be disclosed to the third-party buyer. </li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="international-transfers">6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
					<p><strong>6.1</strong> The Maps.me Service is offered to a global audience - our Users and our
						operations are spread around the world. As a result, we collect and transfer Personal Data on a
						global basis. That means that we may transfer your Personal Data to locations outside of your
						country. </p>
					<strong>6.2</strong> Where we transfer your Personal Data from within the EEA or the United Kingdom
					to outside the EEA or the United Kingdom we will ensure that it is protected and transferred in a
					manner consistent with legal requirements. This may be done in one of the following ways:

					<p><strong>10.1</strong> To the extent that we collect Personal Data with the help of Cookies we
						will process them in accordance with this section 10 of the Privacy Notice. </p>
					<p><strong>10.2</strong> Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our
						website. A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps
						the Website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other
						settings. That can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies play an
						important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience. This
						helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to
						improve our site.</p>
					<p><strong>10.3</strong> A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your
						browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is
						transferred to your computer’s hard drive.</p>
					<strong>10.4</strong> We use the following cookies:
					<ul class="bullet">
						<li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies.</strong> These are cookies that are required for the
							operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into
							secure areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services.</li>
						<li><strong>Analytical or performance cookies.</strong> These allow us to recognise and count
							the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using
							it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users
							are finding what they are looking for easily.</li>
						<li><strong>Functionality cookies.</strong> These are used to recognise you when you return to
							our website. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and
							remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).</li>
						<li><strong>Targeting cookies.</strong> These cookies record your visit to our website, the
							pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make
							our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. [We may
							also share this information with third parties for this purpose].</li>
					</ul>
					<strong>10.5</strong> Please note that the following third parties may also use cookies, over which
					we have no control. These named third parties may include, for example, advertising networks and
					providers of external services like web traffic analysis services. These third party cookies are
					likely to be analytical cookies or performance cookies or targeting cookies:

						<li>Yandex.Metrika</li>
						<li>CloudFlare</li>
						<li>AddThis</li>

					<p>There are ways you can control and manage cookies on your device. Please remember that any
						settings you change will not just affect the cookies we use. These changes will apply to all
						websites you visit (unless you choose to block cookies from particular sites).</p>
					<strong>10.6</strong> <strong>Managing cookies in your browser</strong><br>
					Most browsers will allow you to choose the level of privacy settings you want. You can block all
					cookies, or accept all cookies or pick a setting somewhere in between. This range lets you control
					your cookie settings, so you can:
					<ul class="dash">
						<li>Block third party cookies;</li>
						<li>See what cookies you've got and delete them on an individual basis;</li>
						<li>Block all cookies from being set;</li>
						<li>Block cookies from particular sites;</li>
						<li>Delete all cookies when you close your browser;</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Deleting cookies means that any preference settings you have made on a website will be lost. If
						you’ve set your preferences to opt out of cookies, this setting will be lost too, as that
						information is stored in a cookie. Blocking all cookies means functionality on our websites will
						be lost, as described above. We don’t recommend turning all cookies off when using our websites.
					</p>
					<p>If you want to reduce your cookie settings at any time – for example, if you accept all cookies,
						but later decide you don’t want a certain type of cookie – you’ll need to use your browser
						settings to remove any third party cookies dropped on your previous visit.</p>
